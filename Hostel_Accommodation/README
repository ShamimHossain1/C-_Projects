# Hostel Accommodation System

This is a C++ application that simulates a hostel accommodation system. It allows students to reserve beds in a hostel and saves the data to files for persistence.

## Features

- **Hostel Management**: Maintain information about the hostel, such as name, rent, and available beds.
- **Student Information**: Input and store student details like name, roll number, and address.
- **Bed Reservation**: Reserve a bed if available, with details updated in a file.
- **File Handling**: All data is stored and managed in text files for persistence.

## Files Used

- `HostelFile.txt`: Stores hostel details, including rent and the number of available beds.
- `StudentFile.txt`: Logs details of students who reserve beds.

## How It Works

1. The program initializes hostel information and saves it in `HostelFile.txt`.
2. Students can choose to reserve a bed by providing their details.
3. If a bed is available, the program updates the file with the new bed count and logs the student's details in `StudentFile.txt`.
4. If no beds are available, the program informs the user.

## Sample Menu

```text
	Welcome To Hostel Accommodation System
	**************************************
	1.Reserve A Bed.
	2.Exit.
	Enter Choice: 
```
