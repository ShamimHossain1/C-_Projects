# Supermarket Billing System

This project is a simple **Supermarket Billing System** implemented in C++. It allows users to manage inventory, add items to a bill, and calculate the total amount for purchased items. The system operates through a command-line interface with features to enhance usability and streamline the billing process.

## Features

1. **Add Items to Inventory**
   - Input item name, rate, and quantity.
   - Save the items into a file (`bill.txt`) for persistent storage.

2. **Print Bill**
   - Retrieve items from the inventory.
   - Generate a bill for selected items and their quantities.
   - Update inventory quantities after each purchase.

3. **Session Management**
   - Allows users to close the session after billing.
   - Displays the total bill amount at the end.

4. **File Management**
   - Uses files (`bill.txt` and `bill_temp.txt`) to manage inventory data.
   - Automatically handles file updates and renaming.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Handles insufficient stock scenarios.
   - Provides feedback if items are not found in the inventory.

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows (uses `Windows.h` for sleep and clear screen functionality).
- **C++ Compiler**: Compatible with modern C++ standards (e.g., GCC, MSVC).

## Project Structure

```
SupermarketBillingSystem/
|-- main.cpp        # Main source code file
|-- bill.txt        # Inventory file (auto-created if not present)
